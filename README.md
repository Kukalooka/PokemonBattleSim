# PokemonBattleSim

To make this work please import the pokemon.sql file into a databased named "pokemon"

List of things that aren't in or working yet and I might add or fix in the future:
- Types 
- GTS
- Overworld 
- Items
- PvP

This is a non profit project, made purely for fun and to learn 

I"m in the process of removing the Pokemon theme but I'll let it be for now
